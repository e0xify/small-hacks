# Roundcube and X-notifier

X-notifier script to get the number of unread messages in mailboxes of a Roundcube account.

Original script from: http://xnotifier.tobwithu.com/downloads/scripts/roundcube.js This one only counts unread messages in the INBOX.

Changes first described on my blog at http://sjoerd-hemminga.com/2012/12/roundcube-and-xnotifier/
